### **MiniBots is revolutionizing the way courses are set for remote control sailboat racing.**

Traditionally, laying out courses with buoys and anchors is time-consuming and frustrating.

Weâ€™re solving this with **robotic, anchorless buoys** that empower sailors to set up and adjust their courses **more easily, accurately, and quickly** than ever before.
