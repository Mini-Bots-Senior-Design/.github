## MiniBots Senior Design Project ðŸ‘‹

Setting courses for remote control sailboat racing can be a hassle with traditional buoys and anchors,  ultimately leading to frustration and a less enjoyable racing experience. 

Minibots aims to solve this problem by developing robotic anchorless buoys to allow remote control sailors to set and change their courses easier and faster than ever before
